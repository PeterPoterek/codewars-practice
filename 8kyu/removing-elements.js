// Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

// Example:
// ["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]

// None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!

//Solution
function removeEveryOther(arr) {
  let result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 2) {
    result.push(arr[i]);
  }

  console.log(result);
  return result;
}

removeEveryOther([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);
